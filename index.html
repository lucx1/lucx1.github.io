							<center><h1>Kalestia<br>A new language</h1></center>

							<p>Kalestia is a new language, created by our community and is still being developed. The vocabulary isn't anything near to completed, so if you like to speak that language and need words that aren't yet created, you can suggest your Kalestian translation and it will most probably be added to the language.</p>

							<p>It is constructed on a completely gender neutral basis which makes it easy to learn without having to memorize genders of every word (like German, Russian, Romanic languages etc).</p>

							<p>Maybe you might still be wondering, why the grammar looks so complex and complicated to learn, if you've had a look into our grammar file. This might be true in some way but Kalestia's grammar is fully build on top of rules for everything with hardly any exceptions for words (even "to be" uses normal conjugation). If you look more deeply into the grammar file, you might also find a general structure and you will see, that a tense, a case etc. always uses the same letter in the ending, regardless of where it appears.</p>

							<h2>Interested?</h2>
							<p>Anyone can contribute and learn it, so we more than welcome you to join our community! And if you need help or have any questions, don't hesitate asking in our community group on Telegram.</p>

							<p>Doors is a custom rom for Android devices that tries to deliver you an experience as similar as possible like on a Windows deivce.</p>
							<p>Doors is still in the very beginning of development, so there is not much to show off about if yet. Still, the Doors community and I promise you that this custom rom is going to be an awesome piece of personalization on your Android phone. You are encouraged to have a look into our GitHub organization or our Telegram group to see what we have done so far - or if you like to, even contribute. We're still looking for developers, so if Android Studio and custom roms is a thing for you, I'd love to welcome you in our developer team.</p>

							<center><h1>Calculator</h1></center>
							<p>The first more or less bigger project I've got into after learning JavaScript (which also was my first programming language) was a calculator. It's a huge bunch of code for that little bit of what it can do, but it was a lot of try and error, bugfixing into headaches back when I created it.</p>
							<p>Regardless of that, this calculator is capable of calculating multiplications before additions properly and some mathematical operations like Sinus and Cosinus. Upon that, it is also able to understand keyboard inputs including a few commands.</p>

							<center><h1>時間</h1></center>
							<p>An additional little project is a clock in Korean and Japanese. It's not a complex kind of code but I just had fun taking on that thing.</p>
